# Suo
Suo (means language) is a [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) made by me, and here's the source of it's [Polyglot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/) project.
## I wanna learn!
**je te wo yi suy suo?** download [Polyglot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/) along with the latest Suo release (or the source, you can pack it manually) and, optionally (but extremely recomended - it adds **µ** and **ー** to your keyboard), [it's keyboard layout for Windows](https://github.com/adrianvic/suo-keyboard-windows/) then open the project and go to "Quiz Generator", configure it and click "Take Quiz"
