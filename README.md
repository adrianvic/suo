# Suo
Suo (means language) is a [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) made by me, and here's the source of it's [Polyglot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/) project.

Suo is made of three kinds of words, think about it like a pyramid, we have less top words and more base words, mostly derivated from top and middle words.
## top words
top words are one letter words used to give meaning to base words, can be used as prefix or suffix. (ex. _y_ - to be)

## middle words
just the same as top words but it's made of two or more letters, and can sometimes derivate from top words. (ex. _su_ - say, do)

## base words
basically everything that's not a top/middle word, subdivided into:
- adjective
- adverb
- article
- conjunction
- hybrid adjective
- hybrid verb
- infinitive
- noun
- preposition
- pronoum
- middle word
- top word
(ex. _µja_ - daytime)
